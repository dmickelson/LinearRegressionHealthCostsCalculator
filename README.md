# Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict healthcare costs using linear regression. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features that influence healthcare expenses, allowing for accurate cost estimations based on individual characteristics.

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: TensorFlow 2.x
- **Model**: Linear Regression
- **Language**: Python
- **Environment**: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TensorFlow Docs

## Dataset

The dataset includes features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, which are used to predict individual healthcare costs.

## Model Architecture

The model utilizes a sequential neural network with dense layers, implementing linear regression for cost prediction. It employs the following components:

- Input layer
- Hidden layers with ReLU activation
- Output layer (linear activation)

## Training Process

- Data preprocessing: Normalization and encoding of categorical variables

- Training: Utilizing early stopping for optimal performance

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Visualizations are provided to illustrate the model's predictions against actual values.

## Usage

1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Build and compile the model
3. Train the model on the prepared data
4. Evaluate the model's performance
5. Make predictions on new data

## Future Improvements
